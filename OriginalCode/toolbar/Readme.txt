-----------------------------------------------

The TubeKit Toolbar is a Firefox extension, allowing one to collect a variety of structured data from YouTube with just a click. With the toolbar, you can (1) extract YouTube video links from any webpage, (2) extract a YouTube video's data, (3) extract a YouTube user's profile data, and (4) search in YouTube with different criteria. 

To install the toolbar, find a file ending in .xpi in this folder. Simply drag and drop this .xpi file to Firefox. Once installed, you will have to restart Firefox. 

Here is the explanation of various toolbar buttons.

    * TubeKit: This takes you to TubeKit homepage.
    * Extract Links: Clicking on this button will parse the displayed webpage (doesn't need to be a YouTube page) and extract any YouTube video links that it has.
    * Video Data: When you click on this button while viewing a YouTube video, it will extract a number of data from that video.
    * User Data: Clicking on this button while looking at a YouTube user's profile page will extract the profile data.
    * Search YouTube: You can enter your query here, choose the sorting criteria from the dropdown box and hit 'Search YouTube' to run your query on YouTube with the criteria you specified.

REMEMBER: This is a beta version of TubeKit Toolbar and it is constantly being enhanced. You should enter your email on TubeKit website to stay informed about the latest developments and releases. The website also has user forums for technical support and discussion.
